In the summer term of 2020 I designed and taught a course on the anaylsis of hybrid systems at the Technical University of Darmstadt,
which focused on Hybrid Automata and Differential Dynamic Logic. The course material is available [here](https://moodle.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/course/view.php?id=845) if you are enrolled at TU Darmstadt. If you want to access the material otherwise, please contact me.
