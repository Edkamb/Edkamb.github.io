Hybrid ABS is an extension of ABS with encapsulated continuous behavior. Each hybrid active object is an active object with a set of differential equations that
describe the internal evolution of its state whenever time advances. Hybrid ABS is simulatable and enables to use the high-level code structuring principles
of ABS, such as modules or product lines, for distributed hybrid systems.

A VM with Hybrid ABS is available [here](https://formbar.raillab.de/en/publications-and-tools/hybrid-abs/). Chisel, a tool for modular verification is available on [github](https://github.com/Edkamb/chisel-tool).
