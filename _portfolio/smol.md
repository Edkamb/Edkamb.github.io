The *S*emantic *M*icro *O*bject *L*anguage is an object oriented-language that implements semantic lifting: at runtime programs states are interpreted as knowledge graphs and enriched with ontological knowledge. The program can than query its own knowledge graph and semantically reflect on itself and use domain knowledge expressed in OWL ontologies directly at runtime to guide the execution.
The type system extends to the queries and ensures that their execution does not result in a type error.

SMOL can load and lift simulation units defined by the [FMI](https://fmi-standard.org/).
A detailed manual and documentation are available in the github [repository](https://github.com/smolang/SemanticObjects).
