I am an Assistant Professor at the IT University of Copenhagen, associated with the [Software Quality group](https://square.itu.dk/), where I work on self-adaptive digital twins, software engineering for knowledge graphs, and deductive verification. I also hold a part-time position as Senior Researcher with the University of Oslo, where I am associated with the [Reliable Systems group](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/groups/psy/index.html).
I got my PhD from the Technical University of Darmstadt under the supervision of [Reiner Hähnle](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/se/gruppenmitglieder/groupmembers_detailseite_30784.en.jsp) on modularity in deductive verification.

My research focuses on the integration of technologies and theories from the Semantic Web with formal methods to specify, analyse and simulate data-heavy computational systems, in particular Digital Twins. I am developing and maintaining the [SMOL](https://smolang.org/) language which enables programs to use knowledge graphs for reflection and data access.
Furthermore, I research novel approaches to modularity in deductive program verification, in particular notions of contracts for distributed and hybrid systems.
